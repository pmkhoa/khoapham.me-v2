To setting up Amazon Web Services, the process of setting up an EC2 on Amazon Web Services (AWS) is not complicated, all you need to get a server up and running are Apache, PHP,  MySQL.
Here are some initial steps that help you get started:
<!--more-->

### 1. SSH connect to you EC2 instance.
To connect to your instance, you need the private key and the elastic IP address that associate with your instance. You can create an associated elastic IP address right in your Amazon Console Management.

		ssh -i [FILE NAME].pem ec2-user@[IP ADDRESS]

### 2. Once you're connected, install update on your instance.

		sudo yum -y update

### 3. Install PHP &amp; its package.

		sudo yum install php php-mysql php-xml php-mcrypt php-mbstring php-cli php-devel php-pdo php-pear
		sudo pear install Log
		sudo yum install -y pcre-devel

### 4. Install Apache http.
		sudo yum install httpd

### 5. Install MySQL
		sudo yum install mysql-server mysql-devel mysql

### 6. Install PHP APC module
		sudo yum install php-pecl-apc

### 7. Configure MySQL and PHP
 Before you get everything running, make sure to check the PHP and MySQL configuration files.

- The PHP configuration file is php.ini, which is located under /etc/php.ini. Open the php.ini and increase memory limit to: 128M (or bigger if you wish to).

		<pre>sudo vim /etc/php.ini
		memory_limit = 128M</pre>

- The MySQL configuration file is my.cnf located under /etc/my.cnf. Change it to this:

		<pre>[mysqld]
		datadir=/var/lib/mysql
		socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

		# Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks
		symbolic-links=0
		# Settings user and group are ignored when systemd is used.
		# If you need to run mysqld under a different user or group,
		# customize your systemd unit file for mysqld according to the
		# instructions in http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd
		skip-external-locking
		long_query_time=1
		slow_query_log
		slow_query_log_file=/var/log/log-slow-queries.log
		log-bin=mysql-bin
		server-id= 1
		key_buffer_size = 256M
		max_allowed_packet = 3M
		table_open_cache = 64
		read_buffer_size = 4M
		read_rnd_buffer_size = 8M
		myisam_sort_buffer_size = 16M
		thread_cache_size = 8
		query_cache_size= 32M
		thread_concurrency = 8
		[mysqld_safe]
		log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
		pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
		myisam_recover_options</pre>

Now you have all packages installed, you can start your web server by starting mysql-server and httpd.

		sudo service mysqld start
		sudo service httpd start

Auto start mysql server, and httpd.

		sudo /sbin/chkconfig --levels 235 mysqld on
		sudo /sbin/chkconfig --levels 235 httpd on
