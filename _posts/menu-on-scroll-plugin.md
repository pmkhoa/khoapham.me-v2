Today I just released menuOnScroll - jQuery plugin that automatically updates the menu
navigation when you scroll. This functionality is extremely common on the web,
especially for the single page website. <!--more-->
Since everyone just keeps build the similar thing over and over again, I think it's better to create a simple plugin that will help to save our time.

This plugin is the first open source (MIT) project that I've done, and I am
super excited about this. Writing open source code really help me to write my
code cleaner because I kept refactoring my code over and over again in order to
make it not only easy to read but also to maintain. This is very important
factor that helps me to become a better developer.

I hope you will find this plugin useful in some way. Here is the [source
code](https://github.com/pmkhoa/jquery-menuOnScroll) if you want to check it
out.

Cheers! Happy Thanksgiving!
