Even though I didn't do a very good job with all my resolution in 2020, it has
become my new year tradition to think of what I really want to do or get better in the new
year. This year 2021, things are still a little bit uncertain, I set some goals
and hope that I can achieve them by end of year. Happy Year Year 2021!
